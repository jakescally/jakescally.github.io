        <title>What is this blog?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This blog is supposed to serve as a portfolio/documentary/place to store descriptions of all of the stuff or projects I work on. I plan on including some of my physics research, my astrophotography, projects I work on at FSU’s FABLAB, old cameras, cool pictures, old TVs, and much much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, at some point I’ll be like “Oh remember that project I did years ago?” and I’ll be able to go look for it and remind myself what the project was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or I can use this blog to show to employers and others as a catalog of what I do in my free time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dome posts will be small, some will be longer. Maybe I just want to write something down (like how to add posts to this website in case I forget!). Or maybe I want to compare a bunch of different cameras I’ve owned. Who knows!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I’m glad everything is up and running now. Hopefully I keep this updated but ‘the best laid plans of mice and men’ etc etc…&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Orange Moon Picture</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This was taken just outside of Tallahassee on my way home from an attempted astrophotography night. The astro pictures didn’t come out like I hoped, but I saw this as I drove home and just had to take pictures of it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Imaging the Orion Nebula</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a shot of the Orion Nebula I got in Tallahassee. I’ll explain more in-detail at a later date, as I don’t quite have the time right now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Imaging Andromeda for the First Time</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a stacked image of Andromeda photographed from my backyard. This was in a Bortle 4, so somewhat bright, but I got it on a relatively clear night. Gear was a Canon 80D and whatever that something-to-300mm zoom lens is that Canon makes too.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The CRT Stash As Of 2024</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My wonderful collection of those old TVs everyone throws away. One man’s trash is another man’s treasure, and finding these old TVs has been a hobby of mine for the past couple years&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m super busy right now, so I haven’t had the time to fill in this page, but eventually I’ll list here how I got into the hobby, my first few TVs, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
