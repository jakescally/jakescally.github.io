This blog is supposed to serve as a portfolio/documentary/place to store descriptions of all of the stuff or projects I work on. I plan on including some of my physics research, my astrophotography, projects I work on at FSU's FABLAB, old cameras, cool pictures, old TVs, and much much more.

Hopefully, at some point I'll be like "Oh remember that project I did years ago?" and I'll be able to go look for it and remind myself what the project was. 

Or I can use this blog to show to employers and others as a catalog of what I do in my free time.

Dome posts will be small, some will be longer. Maybe I just want to write something down (like how to add posts to this website in case I forget!). Or maybe I want to compare a bunch of different cameras I've owned. Who knows!

Anyways, I'm glad everything is up and running now. Hopefully I keep this updated but 'the best laid plans of mice and men' etc etc...
