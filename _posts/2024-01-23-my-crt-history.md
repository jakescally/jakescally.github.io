My wonderful collection of those old TVs everyone throws away. One man's trash is another man's treasure, and finding these old TVs has been a hobby of mine for the past couple years

I'm super busy right now, so I haven't had the time to fill in this page, but eventually I'll list here how I got into the hobby, my first few TVs, and more.
